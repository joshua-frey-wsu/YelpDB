# YelpDB

## Project Overview

### General Description

For my database course at my University, I developed a target application which runs queries on the Yelp data and extracts useful information using a Python GUI (PyQt) as the front-end and using PostgreSQL (PgAdmin) as our backend. The primary users for this application will be customers/investors that would like to get information about businesses in a given location. Using this application, the users can gather information about:
  - the businesses in a given state, city, and/or zipcode,
  - the businesses that belong to a certain category,
  - the overpriced, popular, and successful businesses,
  - etc.

The dataset was provided from a "Yelp Dataset Challenge" in 2013, which is available in JSON format [here](https://www.yelp.com/dataset). In addition, you will use a [US Census](https://www.census.gov/) zipcode dataset which provides the population and average income for each US zipcode area in the US. **The JSON files are provided in the Yelp-CptS451 folder**. 

The instructions and the project description is provided in this repo if you would like to know more in depth details about the project.

## Installation

***POSTGRESQL*** - Install PostgreSQL Database Server [here](https://www.postgresql.org/).

***PYTHON*** - Install Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

***PIP*** Install pip [here](https://pypi.org/project/pip/). 

***PyQt*** Install PyQt [here](https://pythonbasics.org/install-pyqt/).

***Psycopg*** Install Psycopg whcih is a PostgreSQL adapter for the Python programming language [here](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/install.html). 


## Quick Start

1. Clone the Repo:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/joshua-frey-wsu/YelpDB.git
   ```
2. Navigate to joshuafrey_milestone3 folder (this is final version).
3. To run the application enter:
   ```
   python milestone3.py
   ```
## Usage

This project was broken down into 3 milestones. Each Milestone had different requirements. Milestone 1 focused on just how to design the project and just toyed around with the tools we would be using. Milestone 2 contains a file which showed how the data was inserted into the database and what Update statements were queried for this project. Milestone 3 contains the finished product.
